## Project Overview

This project implements a quantitative finance tool designed for **Portfolio Optimization** with a primary focus on maximizing the **Sortino Ratio**. Unlike the standard Sharpe Ratio (which penalizes both positive and negative volatility), the Sortino Ratio focuses exclusively on **Downside Deviation (risk of loss)**, aligning the optimization goal with true risk management practices.

The system uses the Monte Carlo simulation technique to test thousands of random asset weight combinations, identifying the allocation that yields the highest return per unit of detrimental risk.

## Key Features

* **Sortino Ratio Maximization:** Optimizes portfolio allocation based on downside risk rather than total volatility.
* **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Quickly explores the feasible investment space to find the optimal portfolio composition.
* **Modular Architecture:** Structured into clear modules (`config.py`, `data.py`, `optimizer.py`, `plots.py`) for maintainability.
* **Professional Visualization:** Generates a unified, multi-panel plot using the `matplotx` library with the **`github-dark`** theme, displaying:
    * Cumulative Performance of the Optimal Portfolio.
    * Max Sortino Portfolio Composition (Pie Chart).
    * Efficient Frontier Scatter Plot colored by Sortino Ratio.
